This chatbot was built as part of my final year university capstone project that I worked on with three others. We created an application that consisted of an interactive AI bot that patients with dementia could speak to as a source of comfort and information when family members or friends were not available. It had a video interface where the patient could speak to a virtual AI with the face and voice of a family member or friend. An image and a voice recording of the family member/friend would be uploaded to the application by a nurse and different people could be selected depending on who the patient wanted to speak to. This repo contains the code for the chatbot portion, which determines the actual content of the response outputted by the bot for any given prompt (input) from the patient.
